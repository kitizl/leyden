Starting goals:
1. Is able to generate from a markdown file, an HTML file
2. Is able to link between multiple markdown files
3. Serve the website on localhost

Current usage is going to look like this. I have a bunch of files in a folder called "content",
and I will produce the results in a folder called "target" (that's within `~/python` here).

My goal is for you to do,

```
leyden build
```

and then it looks through the content/ folder and builds the entire website with HTML and everything
and then it makes the thing.

```
leyden server
```

will then serve the latest updated target things.


Tasks:
- [ ] Implement a markdown to HTML parser
- [ ] Implement a backend structure to keep track of the HTML files
- [ ] Create a server on localhost
- [ ] Serve .html file on localhost

Goals:
- Templating engine to customize look and feel of website beyond just a couple of words
- Includes CSS

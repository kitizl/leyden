Another static site generator. Well, generators.

This is one of the many project ideas I had on hand that I would like to do when I try to learn a new programming language, which is to create a simple static site generator.

Each language gets its own folder and its own implementation of a SSG. Hopefully, all of the features will be identical. Any features that are _new_ will be explained upon in the sub-README of each language.
